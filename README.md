## Core Features ‚ö°

*   **Native Power:** Leverages low level system commands via Rust direct, reliable system shutdown.
*   **Modern UI:** Built with React, React Router, and TailwindCSS for a responsive, smooth, and visually appealing single-page application experience.
*   **Persistent Settings:** Uses Tauri's store plugin to remember your preferences and schedules across sessions.
*   **Multiple Modes:** Choose from various shutdown triggers: timed countdown, specific schedule, or after a period of system idle time.
*   **Background Efficiency:** Runs discreetly in the background using minimal system resources.
*   **Instant Access:** Toggle the application window instantly with a global hotkey ***`(Ctrl + Shift + \)`***
*   **Compact Size:** Remarkably small application footprint ***(approx. `9MB`).***

## ‚ú® In-Depth Look at Features

Auto-Shutdown is designed to be powerful yet unobtrusive. Here's a closer look at what makes it stand out:

*   **Global Hotkey (`Ctrl + Shift + \`):** Instantly show or hide the application window from anywhere in your OS, whether it's focused or running in the background.
*   **Multiple Shutdown Modes:**
    *   ‚è±Ô∏è **Timer Mode:** Set a specific duration (e.g., "shut down in 1 hour 30 minutes").
    *   üóìÔ∏è **Schedule Mode:** Plan shutdowns for specific dates and times (e.g., "shut down every Friday at 11 PM").
    *   üí§ **Idle Mode:** Automatically trigger a shutdown after the system has been inactive for a defined period.
*   **System Autostart:** Configure the app to launch automatically when you log into your computer, ensuring your schedules are always active.
*   **Background Operation:** Runs efficiently in the system tray or background, consuming negligible CPU and RAM when idle. Perfect for "set it and forget it" usage.
*   **Lightweight & Compact:** With an installation size of around 9MB, it won't clutter your system or drain resources.
*   **Modern Audio Cues:** Utilizes subtle, useful sound notifications for key events (like the shutdown warning) without being annoying.
*   **Adjustable View Scale:** While respecting system scaling, the UI elements are designed to be clear and readable. *(Future enhancement: potentially add explicit in-app zoom)*.
*   **Graceful Shutdown Prompt:** The 60-second warning dialog (see screenshot above) ensures you're not caught off-guard and provides an easy way to cancel the pending action.

## Setup and Development üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js, npm/yarn/pnpm, and the Rust development environment with Tauri prerequisites installed. [Tauri Setup Guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project root and run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or yarn install / pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start Development Server:**
    To run the app in development mode with hot-reloading for the frontend:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command starts both the Vite frontend server and the Tauri backend.

4.  **Build for Production:**
    To create optimized, distributable application bundles:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    The output will be located in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

5.  **Tauri Commands:**
    To interact directly with the Tauri CLI (e.g., for plugin management or specific build tasks):
    ```sh
    npm run tauri -- [tauri command]
    # Example: npm run tauri plugin add store
    ```
